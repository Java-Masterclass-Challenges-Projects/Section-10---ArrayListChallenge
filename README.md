# ðŸ§© Game Inventory Manager (ArrayList Challenge - Remixed Edition)

This is a Java console program that simulates a **video game inventory system**.  
It allows players to interactively manage their item list using a menu-driven interface.

The program was built to strengthen understanding of:
- `ArrayList` usage
- Duplicate prevention
- Sorting
- Input normalization
- Console interactivity

This challenge is a **remixed version** of the original ArrayList Challenge â€” refocused around gaming to make the learning process more engaging and memorable.
